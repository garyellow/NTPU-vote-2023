         * Full url at which the app will run combined with the path to authentication. You can set this differently depending on your selected authentication-provider:
         * - `authjs`: You must set the full URL, with origin and path in production. You can leave this empty in development
         * - `local`: You can set a full URL, but can also leave this empty to fallback to the default value of `/api/auth` or set only the path.

         *
         * `baseURL` can be `undefined` during development but _must_ be set to the combination of origin + path that points to your `NuxtAuthHandler` for production. The origin consists out of:
         * - `scheme`: http / https
         * - `host`: e.g., localhost, example.org, google.com
         * - `port`: _empty_ (implies `:80` for http and `:443` for https), :3000, :8888
         *
         * The path then is a string like `/path/to/auth/api/endpoint/root`.
         *
         * ### `local`
         *
         * Defaults to `/api/auth` for both development and production. Setting this is optional, if you set it you can set it to either:
         * - just a path: Will lead to `nuxt-auth` using `baseURL` as a relative path appended to the origin you deploy to. Example: `/backend/auth`
         * - an origin and a path: Will leav to `nuxt-auth` using `baseURL` as an absolute request path to perform requests to. Example: `https://example.com/auth`
         *
         * Note: If you point to a different origin than the one you deploy to you likely have to take care of CORS: Allowing cross origin requests.
